The largest unexploded World War Two bomb ever found in Poland has detonated during an attempt to defuse it.
The RAF dropped the Tallboy or "earthquake" bomb in a raid in 1945 which sank the German cruiser Lützow.
The Polish Navy said there had been a 50:50 chance the bomb would explode and all the divers were unharmed.
The bomb was at the bottom of a Baltic Sea shipping canal, and about 750 residents near the port city of Swinoujscie were evacuated.
